<div class="docs-section">

  <h4>About</h4>

  <p>
  I'm an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harvard SEAS</a> where I lead the <a href="#group">Data-Centric Machine Learning (DCML) group</a>. I'm also an Associate Faculty at the <a href="https://kempnerinstitute.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kempner Institute</a>, and have affiliations with the <a href="https://crcs.seas.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Center for Research on Computation and Society</a> and the <a href="https://datascience.harvard.edu/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harvard Data Science Initiative</a>. I am also a researcher at <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-england/' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Research New England</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  My research seeks to make machine learning more <b>broadly applicable</b> (especially to data-poor applications) and <b>trustworthy</b> (e.g., robust and interpretable). I am particularly interested in the implications of these two directions for applications in the natural and medical sciences. My approach to the first of these goals draws on ideas from statistics, optimization, and applied mathematics, especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_theory_(mathematics)" target="_blank">optimal transport</a>, which I have used to develop methods to mitigate data scarcity by various types of geometric dataset manipulations: <a href="#InvarOT">alignment</a>, <a href="#OTDD">comparison</a>, <a href="#GWGAN">generation</a>, and <a href="#OTGF">transformation</a>.
  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/video/directions-in-ml-automating-dataset-comparison-and-manipulation-with-optimal-transport/">This talk</a> provides a high-level overview of this part of my work.
  As for trustworthy machine learning, I have worked on methods for explaining predictions of <a href="#interpseq">black box models</a>, showed their <a href="#Robust-interpret">lack of robustness</a>, proposed methods to <a href="#SENN">robustify them</a>, and sought inspiration in the social sciences to make them <a href="WOE-HCML">human-centered</a>.
  In the past, I worked on various aspects of learning with highly-structured data such as text or graphs, ranging from <a href="#WE-metric">learning representations</a> of structured objects, to <a href="#DRNN">generating them</a>, to <a href="#interpseq">interpreting models</a> that operate on them.

<!-- ========== BIO ========== -->
<span class="anchor" id="bio"></span>
<div class="docs-section">
  <h4>Bio</h4>
  <p> I obtained a PhD in computer science from MIT, where I worked at <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/">CSAIL</a> on
    various topics in machine learning and natural language processing.
    <!-- % under the
    supervision of <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/tommi/"> Tommi Jaakkola</a>, and close collaboration with <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/stefje/">Stefanie Jegelka</a>. -->
    I also hold BSc (Licenciatura) and MS degrees in mathematics from
     <a href="https://www.itam.mx">ITAM</a> and  <a href="https://www.courant.nyu.edu/">Courant Institute (NYU)</a>,
     respectively. During the latter, I worked on semidefinite programming for
     domain adaptation under the supervision of <a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/">Mehryar Mohri</a>.
     Between Master's and PhD, I spent a year at IBM's T.J. Watson
    Research Center, working with <a
    href="http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-kwchurch">Ken Church </a> and others in the Speech
    Recognition Group.

  abstract = 	 {Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in understanding and generating natural language. However, their capabilities wane in highly specialized domains underrepresented in the pretraining corpus, such as physical and biomedical sciences. This work explores how to repurpose general LLMs into effective task solvers for specialized domains. We introduce a novel, model-agnostic framework for learning custom input tags, which are parameterized as continuous vectors appended to the LLM’s embedding layer, to condition the LLM. We design two types of input tags: domain tags are used to delimit specialized representations (e.g., chemical formulas) and provide domain-relevant context; function tags are used to represent specific functions (e.g., predicting molecular properties) and compress function-solving instructions. We develop a three-stage protocol to learn these tags using auxiliary data and domain knowledge. By explicitly disentangling task domains from task functions, our method enables zero-shot generalization to unseen problems through diverse combinations of the input tags. It also boosts LLM’s performance in various specialized domains, such as predicting protein or chemical properties and modeling drug-target interactions, outperforming expert models tailored to these tasks.}

  abstract = 	 {Various machine learning tasks, from generative modeling to domain adaptation, revolve around the concept of dataset transformation and manipulation. While various methods exist for transforming unlabeled datasets, principled methods to do so for labeled (e.g., classification) datasets are missing. In this work, we propose a novel framework for dataset transformation, which we cast as optimization over data-generating joint probability distributions. We approach this class of problems through Wasserstein gradient flows in probability space, and derive practical and efficient particle-based methods for a flexible but well-behaved class of objective functions. Through various experiments, we show that this framework can be used to impose constraints on classification datasets, adapt them for transfer learning, or to re-purpose fixed or black-box models to classify {—}with high accuracy{—} previously unseen datasets.}

  abstract = 	 {Generative Adversarial Networks have shown remarkable success in learning a distribution that faithfully recovers a reference distribution in its entirety. However, in some cases, we may want to only learn some aspects (e.g., cluster or manifold structure), while modifying others (e.g., style, orientation or dimension). In this work, we propose an approach to learn generative models across such incomparable spaces, and demonstrate how to steer the learned distribution towards target properties. A key component of our model is the Gromov-Wasserstein distance, a notion of discrepancy that compares distributions relationally rather than absolutely. While this framework subsumes current generative models in identically reproducing distributions, its inherent flexibility allows application to tasks in manifold learning, relational learning and cross-domain learning.}

  abstract = 	 {Many problems in machine learning involve calculating correspondences between sets of objects, such as point clouds or images. Discrete optimal transport provides a natural and successful approach to such tasks whenever the two sets of objects can be represented in the same space, or at least distances between them can be directly evaluated. Unfortunately neither requirement is likely to hold when object representations are learned from data. Indeed, automatically derived representations such as word embeddings are typically fixed only up to some global transformations, for example, reflection or rotation. As a result, pairwise distances across two such instances are ill-defined without specifying their relative transformation. In this work, we propose a general framework for optimal transport in the presence of latent global transformations. We cast the problem as a joint optimization over transport couplings and transformations chosen from a flexible class of invariances, propose algorithms to solve it, and show promising results in various tasks, including a popular unsupervised word translation benchmark.}

  abstract = 	 {Optimal Transport has recently gained interest in machine learning for applications ranging from domain adaptation to sentence similarities or deep learning. Yet, its ability to capture frequently occurring structure beyond the "ground metric" is limited. In this work, we develop a nonlinear generalization of (discrete) optimal transport that is able to reflect much additional structure. We demonstrate how to leverage the geometry of this new model for fast algorithms, and explore connections and properties.  Illustrative experiments highlight the benefit of the induced structured couplings for tasks in domain adaptation and natural language processing.}

  abstract = 	 {Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in understanding and generating natural language. However, their capabilities wane in highly specialized domains underrepresented in the pretraining corpus, such as physical and biomedical sciences. This work explores how to repurpose general LLMs into effective task solvers for specialized domains. We introduce a novel, model-agnostic framework for learning custom input tags, which are parameterized as continuous vectors appended to the LLM’s embedding layer, to condition the LLM. We design two types of input tags: domain tags are used to delimit specialized representations (e.g., chemical formulas) and provide domain-relevant context; function tags are used to represent specific functions (e.g., predicting molecular properties) and compress function-solving instructions. We develop a three-stage protocol to learn these tags using auxiliary data and domain knowledge. By explicitly disentangling task domains from task functions, our method enables zero-shot generalization to unseen problems through diverse combinations of the input tags. It also boosts LLM’s performance in various specialized domains, such as predicting protein or chemical properties and modeling drug-target interactions, outperforming expert models tailored to these tasks.}

  abstract = 	 {Various machine learning tasks, from generative modeling to domain adaptation, revolve around the concept of dataset transformation and manipulation. While various methods exist for transforming unlabeled datasets, principled methods to do so for labeled (e.g., classification) datasets are missing. In this work, we propose a novel framework for dataset transformation, which we cast as optimization over data-generating joint probability distributions. We approach this class of problems through Wasserstein gradient flows in probability space, and derive practical and efficient particle-based methods for a flexible but well-behaved class of objective functions. Through various experiments, we show that this framework can be used to impose constraints on classification datasets, adapt them for transfer learning, or to re-purpose fixed or black-box models to classify {—}with high accuracy{—} previously unseen datasets.}

  abstract = 	 {We provide a new approach to training neural models to exhibit transparency in a well-defined, functional manner. Our approach naturally operates over structured data and tailors the predictor, functionally, towards a chosen family of (local) witnesses. The estimation problem is setup as a co-operative game between an unrestricted \emph{predictor} such as a neural network, and a set of \emph{witnesses} chosen from the desired transparent family. The goal of the witnesses is to highlight, locally, how well the predictor conforms to the chosen family of functions, while the predictor is trained to minimize the highlighted discrepancy. We emphasize that the predictor remains globally powerful as it is only encouraged to agree locally with locally adapted witnesses. We analyze the effect of the proposed approach, provide example formulations in the context of deep graph and sequence models, and empirically illustrate the idea in chemical property prediction, temporal modeling, and molecule representation learning.}

  abstract = 	 {Generative Adversarial Networks have shown remarkable success in learning a distribution that faithfully recovers a reference distribution in its entirety. However, in some cases, we may want to only learn some aspects (e.g., cluster or manifold structure), while modifying others (e.g., style, orientation or dimension). In this work, we propose an approach to learn generative models across such incomparable spaces, and demonstrate how to steer the learned distribution towards target properties. A key component of our model is the Gromov-Wasserstein distance, a notion of discrepancy that compares distributions relationally rather than absolutely. While this framework subsumes current generative models in identically reproducing distributions, its inherent flexibility allows application to tasks in manifold learning, relational learning and cross-domain learning.}

  abstract = 	 {Many problems in machine learning involve calculating correspondences between sets of objects, such as point clouds or images. Discrete optimal transport provides a natural and successful approach to such tasks whenever the two sets of objects can be represented in the same space, or at least distances between them can be directly evaluated. Unfortunately neither requirement is likely to hold when object representations are learned from data. Indeed, automatically derived representations such as word embeddings are typically fixed only up to some global transformations, for example, reflection or rotation. As a result, pairwise distances across two such instances are ill-defined without specifying their relative transformation. In this work, we propose a general framework for optimal transport in the presence of latent global transformations. We cast the problem as a joint optimization over transport couplings and transformations chosen from a flexible class of invariances, propose algorithms to solve it, and show promising results in various tasks, including a popular unsupervised word translation benchmark.}

  abstract = 	 {Optimal Transport has recently gained interest in machine learning for applications ranging from domain adaptation to sentence similarities or deep learning. Yet, its ability to capture frequently occurring structure beyond the "ground metric" is limited. In this work, we develop a nonlinear generalization of (discrete) optimal transport that is able to reflect much additional structure. We demonstrate how to leverage the geometry of this new model for fast algorithms, and explore connections and properties.  Illustrative experiments highlight the benefit of the induced structured couplings for tasks in domain adaptation and natural language processing.}

  abstract = 	 {Various machine learning tasks, from generative modeling to domain adaptation, revolve around the concept of dataset transformation and manipulation. While various methods exist for transforming unlabeled datasets, principled methods to do so for labeled (e.g., classification) datasets are missing. In this work, we propose a novel framework for dataset transformation, which we cast as optimization over data-generating joint probability distributions. We approach this class of problems through Wasserstein gradient flows in probability space, and derive practical and efficient particle-based methods for a flexible but well-behaved class of objective functions. Through various experiments, we show that this framework can be used to impose constraints on classification datasets, adapt them for transfer learning, or to re-purpose fixed or black-box models to classify {—}with high accuracy{—} previously unseen datasets.}

  abstract = 	 {Generative Adversarial Networks have shown remarkable success in learning a distribution that faithfully recovers a reference distribution in its entirety. However, in some cases, we may want to only learn some aspects (e.g., cluster or manifold structure), while modifying others (e.g., style, orientation or dimension). In this work, we propose an approach to learn generative models across such incomparable spaces, and demonstrate how to steer the learned distribution towards target properties. A key component of our model is the Gromov-Wasserstein distance, a notion of discrepancy that compares distributions relationally rather than absolutely. While this framework subsumes current generative models in identically reproducing distributions, its inherent flexibility allows application to tasks in manifold learning, relational learning and cross-domain learning.}

  abstract = 	 {Many problems in machine learning involve calculating correspondences between sets of objects, such as point clouds or images. Discrete optimal transport provides a natural and successful approach to such tasks whenever the two sets of objects can be represented in the same space, or at least distances between them can be directly evaluated. Unfortunately neither requirement is likely to hold when object representations are learned from data. Indeed, automatically derived representations such as word embeddings are typically fixed only up to some global transformations, for example, reflection or rotation. As a result, pairwise distances across two such instances are ill-defined without specifying their relative transformation. In this work, we propose a general framework for optimal transport in the presence of latent global transformations. We cast the problem as a joint optimization over transport couplings and transformations chosen from a flexible class of invariances, propose algorithms to solve it, and show promising results in various tasks, including a popular unsupervised word translation benchmark.}

  abstract = 	 {Optimal Transport has recently gained interest in machine learning for applications ranging from domain adaptation to sentence similarities or deep learning. Yet, its ability to capture frequently occurring structure beyond the "ground metric" is limited. In this work, we develop a nonlinear generalization of (discrete) optimal transport that is able to reflect much additional structure. We demonstrate how to leverage the geometry of this new model for fast algorithms, and explore connections and properties.  Illustrative experiments highlight the benefit of the induced structured couplings for tasks in domain adaptation and natural language processing.}

  abstract = 	 {We provide a new approach to training neural models to exhibit transparency in a well-defined, functional manner. Our approach naturally operates over structured data and tailors the predictor, functionally, towards a chosen family of (local) witnesses. The estimation problem is setup as a co-operative game between an unrestricted \emph{predictor} such as a neural network, and a set of \emph{witnesses} chosen from the desired transparent family. The goal of the witnesses is to highlight, locally, how well the predictor conforms to the chosen family of functions, while the predictor is trained to minimize the highlighted discrepancy. We emphasize that the predictor remains globally powerful as it is only encouraged to agree locally with locally adapted witnesses. We analyze the effect of the proposed approach, provide example formulations in the context of deep graph and sequence models, and empirically illustrate the idea in chemical property prediction, temporal modeling, and molecule representation learning.}

  abstract = 	 {Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in understanding and generating natural language. However, their capabilities wane in highly specialized domains underrepresented in the pretraining corpus, such as physical and biomedical sciences. This work explores how to repurpose general LLMs into effective task solvers for specialized domains. We introduce a novel, model-agnostic framework for learning custom input tags, which are parameterized as continuous vectors appended to the LLM’s embedding layer, to condition the LLM. We design two types of input tags: domain tags are used to delimit specialized representations (e.g., chemical formulas) and provide domain-relevant context; function tags are used to represent specific functions (e.g., predicting molecular properties) and compress function-solving instructions. We develop a three-stage protocol to learn these tags using auxiliary data and domain knowledge. By explicitly disentangling task domains from task functions, our method enables zero-shot generalization to unseen problems through diverse combinations of the input tags. It also boosts LLM’s performance in various specialized domains, such as predicting protein or chemical properties and modeling drug-target interactions, outperforming expert models tailored to these tasks.}

  abstract = 	 {Various machine learning tasks, from generative modeling to domain adaptation, revolve around the concept of dataset transformation and manipulation. While various methods exist for transforming unlabeled datasets, principled methods to do so for labeled (e.g., classification) datasets are missing. In this work, we propose a novel framework for dataset transformation, which we cast as optimization over data-generating joint probability distributions. We approach this class of problems through Wasserstein gradient flows in probability space, and derive practical and efficient particle-based methods for a flexible but well-behaved class of objective functions. Through various experiments, we show that this framework can be used to impose constraints on classification datasets, adapt them for transfer learning, or to re-purpose fixed or black-box models to classify {—}with high accuracy{—} previously unseen datasets.}

  abstract = 	 {We provide a new approach to training neural models to exhibit transparency in a well-defined, functional manner. Our approach naturally operates over structured data and tailors the predictor, functionally, towards a chosen family of (local) witnesses. The estimation problem is setup as a co-operative game between an unrestricted \emph{predictor} such as a neural network, and a set of \emph{witnesses} chosen from the desired transparent family. The goal of the witnesses is to highlight, locally, how well the predictor conforms to the chosen family of functions, while the predictor is trained to minimize the highlighted discrepancy. We emphasize that the predictor remains globally powerful as it is only encouraged to agree locally with locally adapted witnesses. We analyze the effect of the proposed approach, provide example formulations in the context of deep graph and sequence models, and empirically illustrate the idea in chemical property prediction, temporal modeling, and molecule representation learning.}

  abstract = 	 {Generative Adversarial Networks have shown remarkable success in learning a distribution that faithfully recovers a reference distribution in its entirety. However, in some cases, we may want to only learn some aspects (e.g., cluster or manifold structure), while modifying others (e.g., style, orientation or dimension). In this work, we propose an approach to learn generative models across such incomparable spaces, and demonstrate how to steer the learned distribution towards target properties. A key component of our model is the Gromov-Wasserstein distance, a notion of discrepancy that compares distributions relationally rather than absolutely. While this framework subsumes current generative models in identically reproducing distributions, its inherent flexibility allows application to tasks in manifold learning, relational learning and cross-domain learning.}

  abstract = 	 {Many problems in machine learning involve calculating correspondences between sets of objects, such as point clouds or images. Discrete optimal transport provides a natural and successful approach to such tasks whenever the two sets of objects can be represented in the same space, or at least distances between them can be directly evaluated. Unfortunately neither requirement is likely to hold when object representations are learned from data. Indeed, automatically derived representations such as word embeddings are typically fixed only up to some global transformations, for example, reflection or rotation. As a result, pairwise distances across two such instances are ill-defined without specifying their relative transformation. In this work, we propose a general framework for optimal transport in the presence of latent global transformations. We cast the problem as a joint optimization over transport couplings and transformations chosen from a flexible class of invariances, propose algorithms to solve it, and show promising results in various tasks, including a popular unsupervised word translation benchmark.}

  abstract = 	 {Optimal Transport has recently gained interest in machine learning for applications ranging from domain adaptation to sentence similarities or deep learning. Yet, its ability to capture frequently occurring structure beyond the "ground metric" is limited. In this work, we develop a nonlinear generalization of (discrete) optimal transport that is able to reflect much additional structure. We demonstrate how to leverage the geometry of this new model for fast algorithms, and explore connections and properties.  Illustrative experiments highlight the benefit of the induced structured couplings for tasks in domain adaptation and natural language processing.}

    <h5> Teaching Philosophy </h5>
  Explaining <i> is </i> understanding.<br><br>

  The following extract is from David Goldstein's <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Feynman_s_Lost_Lecture.html?id=ysZI5NcksUcC&hl=en" style="text-decoration: none">book</a> on Feynman: </p>

  <blockquote>
  "Feynman was a truly great teacher. He prided himself on being able to devise ways to explain even the most profound ideas to beginning students. Once, I said to him, "Dick, explain to me, so that I can understand it, why spin one-half particles obey Fermi-Dirac statistics." Sizing up his audience perfectly, Feynman said, "I'll prepare a freshman lecture on it." But he came back a few days later to say, "I couldn't do it. I couldn't reduce it to the freshman level. That means we don't really understand it."

  <h4>Prospective Students/Postdocs/Interns</h4>
  <p>
    I am always looking for motivated students and postdocs to join my group. Unfortunately, I am not able to respond to all emails. So, depending on your situation, please follow one of the follwing routes:
  </p>
    <ul id="ways_to_join">
      <li><strong>You are a prospective PhD student</strong>: please <a href="https://seas.harvard.edu/prospective-students/prospective-graduate-students/how-apply">apply directly to our PhD program</a> and list me as a faculty of interest. Applying to CS or Applied Math are both fine. Admissions are centralized and made by committee. </li>
      <li><strong>You are a student already at Harvard</strong>: send me <a href="mailto:dam@seas.harvard.edu">an email</a> with the subject line "[Prospect] Interested in joining your group (Harvard Student)" and a brief description of your interests and background. </li>
      <li><strong>You are a student interested in an internship or visiting position </strong>: send me <a href="mailto:dam@seas.harvard.edu">an email</a> with the subject line "[Prospect] Interested in joining your group (External Student)" and a brief description of your interests and background. <b>Update</b>: I am not currently taking new visiting students for Fall 2024. Please check back later!   </li>
      <li><strong>You are a prospective Postdoc</strong>: send me <a href="mailto:dam@seas.harvard.edu">an email</a> with the subject line "[Prospect] Interested in joining your group (Postdoc)" with a CV, link to your publications, and a brief description of your interests and background. </li>
    </ul>

    In any of the situations above, <strong>please include the word "Monge" anywhere in your the main body of your email</strong>, to show me you've read this page and are not just sending a generic email to all faculty (I learnt this trick from <a href="https://finale.seas.harvard.edu/">Finale</a>).
    <p>

      If your email is not formatted as above, my filters won't catch it so I will almost certainly not see it.

  <h4>Misc</h4>
  <p>
    Outside of research, I enjoy running, brewing beer and playing guitar.
    <!-- As if writing papers for a living weren't enough, I sporadically write non-academic <a href="" target="_blank">stuff</a> too (mostly short stories/poems in Spanish). -->
    I also like quotes. Here's a few more:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  "We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them." - A. Einstein
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
  "The real danger is not that computers will begin to think like men, but that men will begin to think like computers"  - Syndey J. Harris
